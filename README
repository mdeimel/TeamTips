Team Tips
=========
Site provides text based storage of tips and tricks, and allows for quick full text searching, and searching based on username.

Supports LDAP authentication, if no objects are stored in the LdapInfo table, it defaults to allowing users to login with just a username, and no password.

==Todo==
1 - Pagination, especially important due to the heavy string processing in the index view
2 - Finish admin page
3 - Implement sorting, based on pageloads
4 - Implement easy searching based on username in search field, such as "\tips\<user>"
5 - Add "Random Tip" button
6 - Allow for general browsing of tips (based on create data, page views?)
7 - Fix search results to not show a line in the text twice if two search words are found on the same line
